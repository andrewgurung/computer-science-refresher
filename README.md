## Big O
- The way to analyze how efficient algorithms (or code in this case) without getting too mired in the details
- Can model how much time any function is going to take given n inputs
- Instead of exact figure, we are concerned in the order of magnitude of the number
- For a 3x² + x + 1, we just interested in the x²
- One for loop = O(n)
- Two nested for loop = O(n²)
- No loops = O(1)
- O(log n) if a code employs a divide-and-conquer strategy (often recursive)
  - As you add more terms, the increases in time as you add input diminishes
